# Express/React starter kit

> Work in progress

This is a simple Fullstack boilerplate app.
Uses Node and express in the backend.  Instead of a data base, saves data in a JSON file.
For the front end uses React.


```sh
# In the project directory, to start the Node and client server, you can run:
npm start
# The react server would be on http://localhost:3000/
# NOde server on http://localhost:3001/

# To build the React app go to 'client' and run:
npm run build
```
